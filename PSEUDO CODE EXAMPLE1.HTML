CHARACTER CHECK
 A Type check is used to ensure that an entered string does not contain any unacceptable characters. 

An example scenario might be that a user needs to choose a username. The username cannot contain the ! or @ symbol as they are reserved for admin usernames.

Pseudo code for a validation check like this may look like:

OUTPUT "Please choose a username"
Accepted = False
Find = False
While Accepted = False Do:
​     Username = INPUT()
     length = len(Username)
     FOR x = 0 to Length DO:
          IF Username(x) = "!" OR Username(x) = "@"
               Find = True
          END IF
      END FOR
      IF Find = True THEN:
          Accepted = False
          Find = False
          OUTPUT "Unacceptable Username, cannot contain ! or @ symbols"
          Else:
               Accepted = True
          END IF
END WHILE
OUTPUT "Acceptable username entered"
